"""
This module contains the tests for the Trading212 broker. The tests are done by creating a random portfolios
The broker objects are the responsible for the execution of the orders. They are the ones that update the
portfolio and the market state. The broker is the one that is responsible for the commissions and the slippage.
This broker in particular is the one that is used for the Trading212 platform which does not charge commissions unless
we buy stocks in other currencies. The slippage is the difference between the price that we see in the platform 
and the price that we buy the stock at. In this case the slippage is 0.
